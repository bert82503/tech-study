Get Started with Docker/开始使用Docker
==================================
We have `a complete container solution` for you -
no matter who you are and where you are on your **containerization journey/容器化之旅**.


## Docker for Developers/开发人员
Building and deploying new applications is faster with containers.
**Docker containers wrap up `software and its dependencies` into `a standardized unit for software` development**
that includes `everything it needs to run`: **code, runtime, system tools and libraries**.
This guarantees that your `application` will always `run the same` and
makes `collaboration` as simple as `sharing a container image`.

Docker containers are backed by `Docker tools and APIs` and help you build better software:
* On board faster and stop wasting hours trying to `set up development environments`,
  spin up new instances and make copies of production code to run locally.
* Enable **polyglot development/多语言开发** and **use any language, stack or tools** without worry of `application conflicts`.
* Eliminate `environment inconsistencies/环境不一致` and the `"works on my machine" problem` by
  **packaging the application, configs and dependencies into `an isolated container`/将应用，配置和依赖项打包到一个隔离的容器中**.
* Alleviate concern over application [security](https://www.docker.com/products/security)/应用安全

`Try Docker containers` with [free, hosted lab tutorials](https://training.play-with-docker.com/) or
download the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) application to start building.


## Docker for IT Operations/IT运营
Docker has enabled developers to use `containers` when working on any application -
whether is a `new microservice` or an `existing application`.
**Containers package up the code, configs and dependencies into an isolated bundle**,
potentially making the application more `secure` and `portable`.
However, when you need to manage an entire portfolio of applications,
containers alone are not enough as they `do not directly address`
**the compliance, security and operational governance needs** of your organization.

An enterprise-ready [container platform](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-enterprise) is needed to
provide **an integrated software lifecycle and operations management workflow and security**
at scale with the assurances of enterprise support and a certified `technology ecosystem`.
The Docker Enterprise container platform delivers **freedom of choice, agile operations and integrated security**
so you can confidently **deploy, manage and secure your applications in production**.

需要一个企业级容器平台，以提供大规模的**集成软件生命周期和运营管理工作流程和安全性**。
Docker企业级容器平台提供**自由的选择，灵活的操作和集成的安全性**，这样您就可以放心地在生产中部署，管理和保护您的应用。

## Docker for the Executive
Digital and cloud initiatives are what drive a competitive edge for your business.
Your new and existing applications are business-critical assets
that can help you be competitive today and set the groundwork for future innovation.
By using Docker’s **container platform and containerization**,
you can gain more efficiencies with your applications while dramatically reducing IT costs
--both capital expense and operational efficiencies--
while improving developer productivity.

您的新应用和现有应用是关键业务资产，可以帮助您在当今保持竞争力，并为未来的创新奠定基础。
通过使用Docker的容器平台和容器化，您可以提高应用的效率，同时显著降低IT成本(资本支出和运营效率)，同时提高开发人员的生产力。

The Docker container platform can `reduce IT costs by 50%` while `accelerating your time to market by 3X`.

Docker offers a broader [containerization strategy](https://www.docker.com/containerization-strategy) that
will provide **a platform for managing and securing the containerized applications** -
reinforced by enterprise-grade services and support.
