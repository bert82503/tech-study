## Reactive - Spring
> https://spring.io/reactive

Reactive systems have certain characteristics that make them ideal for low-latency, high-throughput workloads. Project Reactor and the Spring portfolio work together to enable developers to build enterprise-grade reactive systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven.

An API for asynchronous programming with observable streams

The Observer pattern done right
ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming


## Reactive Streams
> http://www.reactive-streams.org/

Reactive Streams is an initiative to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing with non-blocking back pressure.
